            <p className="bioP">I'm a Software Engineer who loves to code and is passionate about learning and growing. I'm strong in a variety of work environments and pursue excellence in all aspects of a project. I use both technical and soft skills to see people flourish by identifying needs and providing fruitful solutions.

            <p className="bioP">
            I started out as a self-taught hobby coder and quickly fell in love with the craft. I decided to pursue software engineering full-time and received formal education through a three month full-time web development certificate course at the University of Texas in the fall of 2018. Including my course work Iâ€™ve made it my full time job since the spring of 2018 to fully immersing myself and learn all things software engineering.

            <p className="bioP">
            Before becoming an engineer I worked in the non-profit world where there were limited resources and ample amounts of work to be done. This required working in a fast-paced environment, constant communication, setting priorities, wearing many hats, interacting with a variety of different people, and thinking of innovative solutions to a wide range of problems. I'm now blending my past work experience with my coding experience to continue to take part in work that allows others to thrive. I will excel working on a diverse spectrum of dynamic projects throughout the software life cycle and work well in an agile environment both individually and on a team. Most likely all the candidates you will interview will know how to code. I know how to code and have extremely strong soft skills as well.
