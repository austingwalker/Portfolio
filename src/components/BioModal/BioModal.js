            I wrote my first lines of code on Khan Academy and Codeacademy and found that hours would quickly pass by while doing tutorials. Because of my interest I made the decision to take the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp three-month full-time course. The course covered skills and technologies needed to build full stack websites and applications. While taking the course I had to work another job, and as such wasn't able to dedicate the time to learning the material as well as I would have liked. So, at the end of the three-month bootcamp, I decided to invest the time to go back through the entire course of material. I spent 8-14 hours a day at home re-watching every recorded class lecture and re-doing every exercise, homework, and project in order to solidify my understanding of the material and it payed off! Eight months ago I didn't know a single line of HTML or even what a terminal was. Now I am able to build fully functional full stack applications.

            I share my story above to highlight that Iâ€™m dedicated to learning this craft and that I have the drive to self-teach and complete the job at hand with excellence. In my time becoming a developer, it's become apparent that I don't know what I don't know. But, that is one of the things that draws me to coding -- that there is so much to continuously learn. I am hungry to keep pushing myself, grow as a developer, and contribute to a team and company.
